            Hello IS 413! I love c#! I've been working as a web developer at the College of Nursing for the past 10ish months. We use c#, and while
            I am decent at it, I don't consider myself fluent in it by any means. I am hoping that this class will help me to get the spots where I don't
            Under stand what I'm doing, and then fill in the gaps. I love c# and being a web developer!'
